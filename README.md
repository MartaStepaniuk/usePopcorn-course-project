# usePopcorn Project

[Project](https://usepopcorn-course-project.netlify.app/) developed as part of the course ["The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) together with instructor [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

While doing this project, I started thinking more about components, composition and reusability. I learned the useEffect hook to fetch data correctly in React. In addition, I also learned about the useRef hook, what custom hooks are and how to create them, and a detailed look at the useState hook (such as initializing state with a callback).
